1. Copy .env.example to .env and fill values.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Create DB and run db/schema.sql on your Azure SQL (or local SQL Server).
4. Start: `npm run dev` (requires nodemon) or `npm start`.



Use Azure App Service or Azure Functions (with HTTP) to deploy. Put DB credentials into App Service Configuration or Key Vault, not code.
For local development you can run SQL Server in Docker: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server.
Add pagination, filtering, and tests as needed.
Consider using stored procedures for complex logic and ensure least-privilege DB user.
